Milestone for second stage:
2,3,4,5 original steps should be done

Milestone for third stage:
all work plan should be done with some additional tasks, and tested

##### What was done for second stage and what will be done for third stage:

2,3,4 original steps was done for the current moment, step 5 is not needed for this moment
and should be done after finishing step 6. For step 6 there is still need to write a custom map
some main game functions is needed maybe some jquery part will be added. As one the additional tasks 
will be picked thats to add the sounds into game, as the original music was found only need is to write code.

So the plan for third stage:

Add game sounds
Add some levels not just one
