                    <h2>Ghost moods</h2>
                    The ghosts have two different moods that change the way they act during the game.
                    <h3>Scatter mood</h3>
                    <p>This is the default mood. When ghosts are in scatter mood, they will just go to their home corner and stay there.</p>

                    <h3>Chase mood</h3>
                    <p>After a certain time the ghosts change their mood and want to go chasing pacman. This is indicated through the walls turning red.</p>

                    <h3>Pills</h3>
                    <p>The goal of every level is, to eat all the white pills without getting catched by the ghosts. One pill results in 10 points.</p>
                    <h3>Powerpills</h3>
                    <p>In every level there are 4 powerpills, which are a bit bigger than the regular ones. If Pacman eats those, he will get strong enough to eat the ghosts. You can see this indicated by the ghosts turning blue. One powerpill results in 50 points.</p>
